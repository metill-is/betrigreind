# A ggplot with 4 facets showing the bias-variance trade-off
# One facet for each of the following:
# - low bias, low variance: a distribution that is close to the target and has low spread
# - low bias, high variance: a distribution that is close to the target but has high spread
# - high bias, low variance: a distribution that is far from the target but has low spread
# - high bias, high variance: a distribution that is far from the target and has high spread
