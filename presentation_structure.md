Presentation Structure: Bjagi, dreifni og orsakasamhengi
Introduction (2-3 minutes)

Brief welcome and context for the talk
Reference to the event theme: "Gagnagæði – betri greind"
Opening statement about the importance of causal claims in data science and AI
Preview of the three ways to enable causal claims
Visual: Overview diagram of the three approaches

1. Intervening in the World: Randomized Experiments (6-7 minutes)

Ronald Fisher and the Rothamsted Experimental Station
Why the existing observational data was deemed insufficient
The revolutionary concept of randomization in experiments
Key principles of experimental design
How randomization addresses confounding bias
Visual: Simple diagram comparing observational vs randomized data
Legacy: How these principles remain crucial in the AI era

2. Choosing Smart Data: Strategic Observational Studies (6-7 minutes)

Introduction to observational studies and matching
The seat-belts example from Rosenbaum's "Design of Observational Studies"
Cautionary tale: Wu and Zhang (2016) paper
Analysis of what went wrong and how better data selection could have helped
Techniques for improving observational studies
Visual: Diagram showing matching principles and their effects
Key takeaway: Quality over quantity in data selection

3. Modeling the World: Causal Inference and DAGs (6-7 minutes)

Introduction to Judea Pearl's framework
Understanding Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs)
The three main confounders:
    - Forks
    - Colliders
    - Post Treatment Bias
The Asthma example:
    - Building the DAG
    - Identifying testable implications
    - Demonstrating proper causal reasoning
Visual: DAG examples and the Asthma case study
Why this approach matters for modern AI systems

Conclusion (2-3 minutes)

Recap of the three approaches to causal claims
    1. Intervene manually (randomization)
    2. Choose data smartly (matching)
    3. Model your assumptions (DAGs)
The complementary nature of these approaches
Final thoughts on the importance of causal understanding in the AI era
Thank you and invitation for questions
